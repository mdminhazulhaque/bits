Qt 5.2 has built in support for indicating progress and other states in
Windows Taskbar icon.

I followed Qt Doc on `QWinTaskbarButton` and `QWinTaskbarProgress` given [here](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwinextras-overview.html)

Seems like their example is not working for me. So I created a demo program which demonstrates on how to show progress and states using Taskbar.

Here is the preview of my demo app.
